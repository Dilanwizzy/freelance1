# Welcome

## Requirement

Node 20

## Running

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Changes
Ignore console errors to do with the API.

The changes required are mainly in src/routs/videos. 

Should be using Skeleton.dev for components, such as buttons, card, avatar etc. I have also provided the mock up (Instagram reel.png)

Thank you
